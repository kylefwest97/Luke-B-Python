# The Analysis
## 1. What are the most in demand skills for the top 3 Data Jobs?
### I wanted to see which skills were most in demand for the most popular data jobs. The jobs I looked at were Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Data Analysts. Thes were the three jobs with the highest number of potings. Once I identified the top jobs I found the 5 most common skills mentioned across the three job titles. Last I found the percentage of job postings that had each skill.
